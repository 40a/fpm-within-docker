# fpm-within-docker

Pre-baked images for package building. [fpm](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm) is included!

## what does this do?

If you don't want to spend your nights in learning packaging an RPM or a DEB - which is a good idea - FPM can help.
But, out of the box, fpm doesn't provide a "sandbox" or any other "isolated environment" for building. Here comes this set of images.

You should still know something about package building.

For RPM see [Maximum RPM](http://www.rpm.org/max-rpm/), [Fedora RPM Howto](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_create_an_RPM_package), or [Fedora RPM Guide](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora_Draft_Documentation/0.1/html/RPM_Guide/).

For DEB, see [Debian How To Package](https://wiki.debian.org/HowToPackageForDebian) or [Ubuntu Packaging New Software](http://packaging.ubuntu.com/html/packaging-new-software.html).

You'd better know what [docker](https://www.docker.com/) is, as well.

## Usage

Take a look at the example in the [example project](example-project) directory - it's an example build of a [lua interpreter](http://www.lua.org)
for Centos7 and Ubuntu Trusty. The directory contains the extracted source of lua 5.3.1, while the [packaging](example-project/packaging) dir contains our build scripts. The main build scripts are commented and will tell you what you should know: see [build for centos 7](example-project/packaging/centos-7/build) and [build for ubuntu trusty](example-project/packaging/ubuntu-trusty/build)

## Limitations

Currently the images are x86_64 only. There's an exception for
centos5 i386, since I had an actual use case, but its creation
was very tedious, and docker doesn't officially endorse 32 bit guests.

I'll add 32 bit images only if help is provided.

## Using the fpm-within-docker images

They're available on Docker hub. All of them are just tagged **latest**.
I'll usually add images for Centos, Fedora, Ubuntu and Debian as soon
as they get out, and I'll try supporting them as long as they're supported upstream.

Take a look at the repository; all the directories starting with *fwd* are the sources
for their respective images, which can be found on [my page on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/alanfranz/)

All images are tagged "latest"; so, for Centos 7 you'd use the **alanfranz/fwd-centos-7:latest**
docker image.
